# Code sets used in the study: Ensemble approach for flash flood forecasting: A case study of the Kinu River flood of 2015.  

## figures  
figures used in the manuscripts.  

## preProcess  
Scripts to process the meteorological datasets to match the resolution of land surface model. As the land surface model used in this study uses its original encoding style (gtool format), decoding script is also included to convert to plain-binary for the hydrodyamic model.  

## visualization  
Scripts to analyze and visualize the outputs. Mainly coded by Python.  

The other datasets including model outputs and observation data are arichived and publicaly accessible at (http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yuta/EnsembleApproachTowardFlashFloodForecasting.tar.gz). If the file was too big to download or expand to your environment, the author would happily divide the required data from the archived file and provide them.
